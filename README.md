# Data-Science
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb created as part of an assignment for the Coursera course titled IBM Data Science.

Assignment Overview
The goal of this assignment was to create a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the following:

Creating and using markdown cells for documentation.
Writing Python code to perform basic arithmetic operations.
Listing popular data science languages and libraries.
Creating tables and lists in markdown.
Converting units using Python code.
Notebook Content
The notebook includes the following exercises:

Exercise 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook
Created a new Jupyter notebook named DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb.
Exercise 2: Create markdown cell with the title of the notebook
Created a markdown cell with an H1 style heading for the title "Data Science Tools and Ecosystem".
Exercise 3: Create a markdown cell for an introduction
Added an introductory sentence to describe the notebook's purpose.
Exercise 4: Create a markdown cell to list data science languages
Listed popular languages used by data scientists in an ordered list.
Exercise 5: Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries
Listed commonly used data science libraries in an ordered list.
Exercise 6: Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools
Created a table listing three development environment open-source tools used in data science.
Exercise 7: Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples
Added a markdown cell with an H3 style heading to introduce arithmetic expressions.
Exercise 8: Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers
Created a code cell to evaluate the expression (3*4)+5.
Exercise 9: Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours
Created a code cell to convert 200 minutes into hours.
Exercise 10: Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives
Listed key takeaways from the notebook using an unordered list.
Exercise 11: Create a markdown cell to indicate the Author's name
Included the author's name in an H2 style heading.
